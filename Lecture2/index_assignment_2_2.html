		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I love to travel and wanted to see the US without having to spend too much money, so I did an Aupair year in Scarsdale.
		No living costs or daily food expenses, some extra money paid weekly and a lot of time to explore places in the weekend.
		I was also lucky to have a teenager which meant I did not have to spend all day watching a toddler, cooking and cleaning.</p>

		<h2>Travelling different countries</h2>
		<p>Of course I went to New York when I was in the US and had a blast. I also bought some souveniers, but those were quite expensive, 15&#36 for a mug is not it. In London I was able to get a mug for only 9&#163 and in Paris it was also reasonable at 12&#8364</p>
